    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: September 18, 2024</p>

    <p>Welcome to the privacy policy of <strong>LocAlarm</strong>, a service offered by <strong>qub-its inc.</strong>, a company registered in the U.S. state of Delaware. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding your information. <strong>We do not collect or store any personal user data.</strong></p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>LocAlarm is designed to function without collecting or storing any personal user data. We do not track, save, or share your location data or any other personal information. The app uses your deviceâ€™s location temporarily and only for the purpose of providing proximity-based alarms, which occur locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>While LocAlarm accesses your location in real-time to notify you when you are near your set destination, this data is processed exclusively on your device and is not transmitted or stored on any external servers. This ensures your data remains private and secure.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>LocAlarm may use third-party services to enhance the user experience, such as mapping services (Google Maps). These services may collect data as outlined by their respective privacy policies, but LocAlarm does not collect or retain any of this information.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can control the permissions for location access and notifications through your device's settings. LocAlarm requires location permissions to function correctly but does not store or share this information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will notify you by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@qub-its.com">team@qub-its.com</a>.</p>
